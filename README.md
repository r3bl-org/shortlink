## What is it?

Years ago when I used to work at Google, there was a way to create something called a "go link".
Here's a
[deprecated extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shortlink/apgeooocopnncglmnlngfpgggkmlcldf)
in the Chrome store that replicated this functionality. The idea was to create a name that you can
remember to represent one or more tabs. So for example, if you want to visit your "banking" sites,
you can create a shortlink called "banking" to open Bank of America and Bank of the West websites
for example.

This is equivalent to creating a bookmark. Except it is much faster and you can just type "go" into
your chrome address bar, and then press <kbd>Tab</kbd>, then type "banking". Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
and your tabs will reopen!

Currently this browser extension is only available for Chrome. If you would like to contribute there
are plenty of issues that need to be worked on. And one of them is porting this to Firefox and Edge.
